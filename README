Lingua/LA/Stemmer version 0.01
==============================

This is a coarse stemming package for latin language. Words are filtered according to the following steps.

       o converting 'j' or 'v' to 'i' or 'u'
       o removing -que
       o matching the end of word against the noun or adjective suffixes
       o matching the end of word against the verb suffixes

Of course, it's not perfect. Any suggestion is always welcomed to better this package.
